# Personality_KNN_Classifier

🌿 Personality Type Prediction using KNN

📌 Overview

The Personality Type Prediction project uses Machine Learning to classify individuals as Introvert or Extrovert based on behavioral and social activity features. Using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the model learns from patterns in user responses to predict personality type accurately.


Key highlights:

🧹 Cleaned & preprocessed psychometric dataset
🔍 Built a KNN classifier for personality type prediction
📊 Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics
🐳 Dockerized deployment for real-time usage
